*** Updated 4-8-16 ***

This tutorial series for [Accio Code](http://www.youtube.com/user/CDPAdvertising "Accio Code on YouTube") is a beginner's course in D3.js, a JavaScript library for displaying data dynamically on a website.

In this course we will be installing and running d3.js and learn the basics of how to use data to create charts, graphs, shapes, objects and a few useful lessons on making your own d3.js projects.

## What is D3js ##
D3.js (Data Driven Documents) is not a programming language. It is a JavaScript based library used for creating dynamic data displays.
D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.
